# Kitchen-To-Ol
A creepy and sneaky web crawling bot (not rilly a chatbot like other dudes in my Github, but still a bot - don't ban me Microsoft).
## I. Guide:
### 1. Installing:
- To run this shi (Windows):
```
python -m venv venv # Watever Python is fine
"./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python crawl_web_script/main.py
```
- For Linux shi, look on Google, but the gist is the same (change the effing ```"./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"``` to something Penguin-like).
### 2. Trivia:
- Run ```.ipynb``` file to avoid the loss of links when the file crashes. It is made carefully and steadfastly (as I am obviously so great and mightiful, whatever). However, lest your peasant's pc or Internet got some error, you wouldn't be destroying your own pc out of wroth.
## Other things:
- Nothing for now. Enjoy it.
